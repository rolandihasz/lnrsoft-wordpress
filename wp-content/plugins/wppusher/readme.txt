= Get started =

If you already use Git for your projects and your themes and plugins are in their own repositories on GitHub, getting started with WP Pusher is simple and easy. Just go to "New plugin" or "New theme" in the WP Pusher menu and type in the repository for the package: github-username/repository-name

If any of your plugins or themes are in private repositories on GitHub, WP Pusher will need a token to access them. You can read GitHub's guide to application tokens [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/). Paste in the token at WP Pusher settings page.

= Conventions =

* Theme stylesheets _must_ be named the same as the repository
* Plugin directories _must_ be named the same as the repository
* GitHub version tags _must_ be numeric, such as '1.0' or '1.0.1', with an optional preceding 'v', such as 'v1.0.1'
* WordPress version tags _must_ be numeric, such as '1.0' or '1.0.1'

= Git workflow =

The way WP Pusher works, packages (themes and plugins) need to be in their own repositories. If your packages are in their own repositories already, you can safely skip this section. Some developers prefer having their whole WordPress installation under Git, which potentially makes things a bit more complicated. By having all packages in their own repositories, you can easily share code across clients / projects. Since you shouldn’t be editing the core WordPress code, in most cases having the whole project under Git shouldn’t be necessary. However, if for some reason your project require that you have one Git repository for the whole project, you will have to use Git submodules, so that you can still have every package in its own (sub) repository.

== Changelog ==

= 3.0.18 =

* Security fix (cross-site scripting). The Troubleshooting tab printed the raw replies from the WP Pusher, GitHub, Bitbucket and GitLab servers straight onto the page whenever a connection test failed. Whatever a reply contained was treated as part of the admin page, so a hostile or hijacked server at the other end — including a self-hosted GitLab address entered in your own settings — could run scripts in a logged-in administrator's browser. The diagnostic output is now shown as plain text.
* Dismissing the WP Pusher welcome panel now requires being logged in as an administrator. The "Dismiss" link's address previously worked for anyone who visited it, logged in or not, so a link elsewhere on the web could hide the panel on your site. Nothing else about the panel changed.
* Fixes a failed theme or plugin update leaving the entire site stuck on the "Briefly unavailable for scheduled maintenance" page. When WP Pusher updated your active theme — or any package on a multisite network — and the update failed, WordPress switched maintenance mode on but never switched it off again. The admin saw an error message and assumed the update had simply failed, while every visitor got the maintenance page until someone deleted the `.maintenance` file by hand over FTP. Maintenance mode is now always switched off when an update finishes, whether it succeeded or failed.

= 3.0.17 =

* Security fix (SQL injection). Values taken straight from the web request - the package and repository parameters used by WP Pusher's admin screens and by the Push-to-Deploy webhook - were pasted directly into database queries. The only cleaning applied did not escape quote characters, so a crafted request could alter what those queries did to your WordPress database. Every affected query now uses a prepared statement. All versions up to and including 3.0.16 are affected, so please update.
* Security fix (cross-site scripting). On the Install Plugin and Install Theme screens, the Repository, Branch and Subdirectory fields were echoed back into the form without being escaped, and the form's security-token check was skipped whenever the submitted action was not one WP Pusher recognises. Together that meant a specially crafted link or form could run scripts in a logged-in administrator's browser. All three fields are now escaped. All versions up to and including 3.0.16 are affected, so please update.
* Prevents a fatal error (white screen) when another active plugin defines a PHP class with the same name as WP Pusher's — most commonly BuddyBoss, which bundles the Pusher library. Instead of the site crashing, WP Pusher now stops itself and shows an explanatory notice in the admin telling you which plugin conflicts.
* Further hardens the twice-daily update-check filter (the one behind the 3.0.16 PHP 8 fix). It runs on every update check and could still throw a fatal `TypeError` if another plugin sent an update-check request in an unexpected format; it now checks the request shape before touching it, and keeps the active-plugins list correctly formatted when a WP Pusher package is removed from it.

= 3.0.16 =

* Fixes a fatal `TypeError` on PHP 8 (`array_search(): Argument #2 must be of type array, null given`) at wppusher.php line 82. WP Pusher's filter that hides its own packages from WordPress.org update checks assumed the update payload always contained an `active` key; when it was missing/null (e.g. alongside some other plugins), the plugins screen and WP-CLI would crash. The `active` list is now guarded before use.
* Fixes PHP 8.2 "Creation of dynamic property is deprecated" notices by declaring the previously-dynamic properties `Pusher\Log\Logger::$file`, `Pusher\Dashboard::$pusher`, and `Pusher\Theme::$repository`.
* Fixes misleading error messages when an install or update fails while the downloaded files are being moved into place. Every one of these failures used to report "WP Pusher couldn't find subdirectory in repository", which sent people looking in the wrong place. The message now states the real cause: a missing subdirectory is named along with what the repository root actually contains, an empty checkout is reported as an empty checkout, and a permissions or filesystem failure says so and names the filesystem method in use. Applies to both plugin and theme installs and updates.
* The twice-daily plugin update check now identifies your site URL and license key to the WP Pusher update server, so we can see that your license is still actively installed on a live site. Update checks were previously anonymous. This lets us support you proactively — for example, spotting subscriptions that are still billing for sites that no longer exist. No other data is collected, and nothing is sent if no license key is configured.

= 3.0.15 =

* Fixes Push-to-Deploy webhooks failing on Bitbucket because the webhook URL was not URL-encoded. The base64-encoded package path could end in a `=` character, which Bitbucket rejected as a malformed URL (delivery failed with HTTP status -2 / no response). The package parameter is now URL-encoded.
* Bitbucket webhook creation now sends the access token in the `Authorization: Bearer` header instead of a deprecated query parameter, and reports authentication failures clearly instead of failing silently during install.

= 3.0.14 =

* Fixes Bitbucket installs and updates failing with `PCLZIP_ERR_BAD_FORMAT` after Bitbucket deprecated query-parameter OAuth (CHANGE-3052). The plugin now sends the access token in the `Authorization: Bearer` header.

= 3.0.13 =

* Fixes an issue where the WordPress 5.9 welcome panel styles were bleeding over into WP Pusher's welcome panel
* Adds cURL stats to the troubleshooting tab

= 3.0.6 =

* Fix WP 5.6 issue with empty transients (failing plugin updates)

= 3.0.5 =

* Roll back to old plugins/themes views. We're so sorry about this! We thought we could make a few incremental improvements to the user experience, but ultimately ended up breaking critical features for folks. Not our typical style, which is why we're now rolling back to the old plugins/themes list instead of plugging holes. We promise to give this some love an attention soon - doing our best not to break anything! Again, sorry about this!

= 3.0.4 =

* Fix PHP warning introduced in 3.0.3. Sorry about that one!

= 3.0.3 =

This should not be a breaking change, since 1. root level URLs (wppusher.com) are the same with or without trailing slashes (.com vs .com/) and 2. WordPress always add a trailing slash to a site in a subdirectory (wppusher.com/blog/).
